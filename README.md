# Recruit — AI Powered Automated Interview Analysis Platform

Recruit is an AI-driven automated interview analysis web application designed to evaluate candidate responses using multi-modal machine learning techniques including audio emotion recognition and interview response analytics.

This project is built using Flask for backend web services, integrated with machine learning models for speech-based emotion detection and interview performance scoring, and a responsive frontend for real-time user interaction and visualization.
